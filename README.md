# ETL data Extraction / Transform / Load project written in C#

This is my data extraction and transformation programming project written in C# 
The goal is to write ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) program which is handling with data needed for Business Inteligence analysys.
I have already written such a program in python (see my ETL github projects) but was wondering how it is to write the same program in C#
